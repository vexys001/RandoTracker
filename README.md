| Responsible people  | Yves Morin                                                                                                                 |
| Project Type        | Computer program for users to manually track items during a randomizer run.                                                |
| Project Context     | I wanted to track what i was getting during a randomizer run. I also wanted to get more statistics behind randomizer runs. |
| Objectives          | Program can be used to track the items of a game (Resident Evil 2 Remake Randomizer in my case).                           |
|                     | Other games list can be submitted to the program and work.                                                                 |
|                     | Program can let users track the statistics related to their runs for research.                                             |
| Project Summary     | Program will be realized in Java as an small window program.                                                               |
|                     | It will let users choose the list of items of a game of their choice and track what they obtain using buttons.             |
|                     | A statistics page will be available to register information for randomizer research.                                       |
| Target Audience     | Myself and anyone interested by this                                                                                       |
| Wanted Result       | Well-planned and working Java program with robust code.                                                                    |
| Project Start       | 23-02-2020                                                                                                                 |
| Planned Project End | 04-06-2020                                                                                                                 |
