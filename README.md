| Project Type       | Computer program for users to manually track items during a randomizer run.                                                |
| Project Context    | I wanted to track what i was getting during a randomizer run. I also wanted to get more statistics behind randomizer runs. |
| Objectives         | Program can be used to track the items of a game (Resident Evil 2 Remake in this case).                                    |
Other games list can be submitted to the program and work. 
Program can let users track the statistics related to their runs for research.                                |
| Project Summary    | Program will be realized in Java as an small window program. 
It will let users choose the list of items of a game of their choice and track what they obtain using buttons. 
A statistics page will be available to register information for randomizer research. |
| Target Audience    | Myself and anyone interested by this tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
